We are a community of professionals in disciplines related to software development in the Greater Rochester Area. We are Software and Quality Assurance Engineers, Product Managers and Entrepreneurs, and Students and Teachers looking to share our experiences and knowledge with one another in an effort to support and grow the community as a whole.

Coordinating events, moderating slack, and operating our platforms takes time and money. Please, consider supporting us through this Patreon.
